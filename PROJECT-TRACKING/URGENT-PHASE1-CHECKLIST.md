## 🎯 IMMEDIATE ACTION PLAN (Next 48 Hours)

### Tuesday Morning (2025-11-12, 8:00 AM) ⏰
**FIRST PRIORITY:**
1. 🔴 Email PM: URGENT - Emergency stakeholder meetings required
2. 🔴 Call PM: Explain 6 critical blocking issues
3. 🔴 Request immediate CFO availability (within 12 hours)

**Email Template:**
```
Subject: URGENT - Emergency Stakeholder Meetings Required (6 Blocking Issues)

Dear [PM Name],

We've made exceptional technical progress (88% Phase 1 complete, 27 tables 
analyzed across 4 domains), but have identified 6 CRITICAL issues that require 
immediate stakeholder decisions to proceed with migration:

EMERGENCY (24h):
1. Negative Margin: 21M BGN apparent loss - requires CFO investigation
2. Payment Gap: 2.77M BGN unpaid - requires Finance reconciliation

CRITICAL (48-72h):
3. Dual Delivery: 68.2M BGN bypass audit trail - requires Ops decision
4. Store Concentration: 96% in 5 stores - requires continuity plan
5. Unknown Movements: 63K records unclassified - requires data cleanup
6. Float Conversion: 164M EUR precision risk - requires approval

Can we schedule emergency meetings:
- CFO: 2 hours (today if possible)
- Finance Manager: 1 hour (today/tomorrow)
- Operations Manager: 1.5 hours (this week)
- Warehouse Manager: 1.5 hours (this week)
- + 4 more specialists (Week 3)

Total: ~15 hours across 8 specialists over 4 days

Without these decisions, we cannot proceed with Trade, Financial, or 
Inventory modules.

Best regards,
[Dev Team]
```
