## 🚀 What Changed in Updates

### Before (Incorrect):
- "Financial Domain 75% complete (6/8 tables)"
- "Need to finish: Currencies, PaymentTypes"
- "Next: Complete Financial Domain"

### After (Correct):
- "Financial Domain 100% complete (7/7 tables)" ✅
- "Already includes: doCurrency (7 currencies analyzed)"
- "Next: Continue Trade Domain OR Start Store/Inventory"

### Key Discovery:
The file `analysis/week1/core-tables/financial-domain/FINANCIAL-DOMAIN-COMPLETE.md` exists and shows Financial Domain was already fully analyzed with:
- All 7 tables documented
- €33M+ in financial operations
- Double-entry accounting validated
- Migration complexity assessed
- Comprehensive domain summary

---

## 💡 Lesson Learned

**Always check both old and new folder structures!**
- New structure: `analysis/domains/` (Trade started here)
- Old structure: `analysis/week1/core-tables/` (Products, Financial, Documents completed here)

The Financial Domain was completed earlier but filed in the week1 structure, not the new domains structure.

---

## 🎉 Bottom Line

**YOU'RE AHEAD OF SCHEDULE!**

**3 complete domains = 45% of week 1-2 work**
**16 tables analyzed = Strong foundation**
**€113M+ documented = Significant business coverage**
**Proven methodology = Ready to accelerate**
